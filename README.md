# Collection of Tweets that have mentioned Bill Gates
![alt text][Map]

Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization that have a mention of Bill Gates in the United States during 2020 Covid-19 period. It is interesting to see that most of the tweets are on the East side of the country, this might be the case because most of the East coast views Bill Gates in some what of a negative way because of their theories on his involvement in the Covid-19 virus. 

While the Middle of the United States doesn't have much to say about Bill Gates, both Washington and California are also shining with numerous tweets mentioning Bill Gates. These tweets might be more positive and understanding of his perspective and opinions because of the values the West coasters hold and obviously because Bill Gates has a huge influence in both states because of his tech influence as well as his philanthropic activities that many West coasters see. 

I also see an increase in the number of tweets in the states that have been most effected by Covid-19, including New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, and Washington. That is also something interesting to think about.
